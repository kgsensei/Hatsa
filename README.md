# Hatsa Framework
### By: kgsensei
A framework for hosting static websites.

## How to use?
All you need to do is download the files, edit `server.json`, `urls.txt` and `variables.txt` to your liking and then start the server.

If you want to call one of the variables from an html file just do `{[Variable Name Here]}`. Make sure that its defined in the `variables.txt` file though

## How to download a build?
If you want to download an executable build (for an even faster start) then click here to see the lastest builds: [Releases](https://github.com/kgsensei/Hatsa/releases)

If you want to download the source code all you need to do is download it from this page.

## What can this do?
This project is meant to give the user control over their static website. You can use variables and set up clean urls. It can't do much more than that, but its not meant to. I want this to be an easy solution to hosting your own website. No coding required.
